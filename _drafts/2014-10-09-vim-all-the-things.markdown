Vim is about the greatest thing ever. One of the best things about it is that it's designed to be incredibly efficient and ergonomic. It often just takes a couple keystrokes with Vim to perform an editing task that would take several key combinations or mouse movements with a WYSIWYG word processor. The problem is, it's too good. When you get used to it, you're so spoiled by it that it can be frustrating to work with other programs, because the key commands are so inefficient. With a little configuring, though, you can vimify just about everything about your computing environment. Here's how. 

1. Window manager: awesome wm or i3. 
2. Shell: vim keybindings in BASH. 
3. Web browser: dwb or vimperator.
