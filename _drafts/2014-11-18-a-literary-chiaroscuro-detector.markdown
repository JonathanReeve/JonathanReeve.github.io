In an 1873 review in the *Galaxy*, Henry James criticizes George Eliot's *Middlemarch* as he might a painting: “it abounds in fine shades, but it lacks, we think, the great dramatic *chiaroscuro*” (579). Although James is using the term metaphorically, to denote sweeping emotions and strong contrasts of narrative energy, the same could be said of the visual *mise-en-scène* of the novel. The presence of literal light and darkness in a novel's descriptive tableaux lays a visual foundation that often projects to the greater narrativistic structure. Imagery of intense light and stark shadows is correlated with similarly tumultuous brush strokes in the plot structure--chiaroscuro functions both poetically and narratologically. While this phenomenon is muted in a mezzotint novel like *Middlemarch*, other Victorian novels, especially Charles Dickens's *Bleak House*, exemplify this shadow play. The following study uses both quantative and qualitative methods to juxtapose these two novels, to show how these writers employ optical effects to frame their theatrical expressivity. Where Dickens uses chiaroscuro to heighten dramatic intensity, Eliot uses it as a preliminary artistic maneuver towards a more deliberately subtle mezzotint.
