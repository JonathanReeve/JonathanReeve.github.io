This is my personal website, [[http://jonreeve.com]]

** Technical Details

This uses the wonderful static site generator [[https://github.com/srid/rib/][Rib]], along with other Haskell tools.

** Running

If you want to build this site locally, make sure you have [[https://nixos.org/][the Nix package manager]] installed, and then run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nix-shell --run 'ghcid -WT ":main -wS"'
#+END_SRC
