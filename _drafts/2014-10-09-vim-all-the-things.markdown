Symmetrical Keybindings, or, Vim All the Things

Imagine a world where key commands have a logical symmetry to them. Command (or Windows Key) plus a letter would control the operating system or window manager, Alt plus a letter would control a group of programs, and Control would control the program on the low level. For instance, Command + l would take you to the program on the right. Alt + l would take you to that program's right pane, and Control + l would take you to the right within that pane. There's a logical hierarchy to it. Thankfully, with a little bit of configuration, this is well within reach. 

Vim is about the greatest thing ever. One of the best things about it is that it's designed to be incredibly efficient and ergonomic. It often just takes a couple keystrokes with Vim to perform an editing task that would take several key combinations or mouse movements with a WYSIWYG word processor. The problem is, it's too good. When you get used to it, you're so spoiled by it that it can be frustrating to work with other programs, because the key commands are so inefficient. With a little configuring, though, you can vimify just about everything about your computing environment. Here are the basic ingredients: 

1. Window manager: Awesome WM or i3. 
2. Shell: Vim keybindings in BASH. 
3. Web browser: dwb or the Vimperator / Pentadactyl plugins for Firefox. 
4. Python (interpreter), MySQL, or anything else that uses Readline
  
One of the great things about Vim is that it's ergonimally designed.
