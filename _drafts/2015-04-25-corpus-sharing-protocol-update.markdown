A vibrant discussion followed [my March 15th post, "A Proposal for a Corpus Sharing Protocol."](http://jonreeve.com/2015/03/proposal-for-a-corpus-protocol/). [Carrie Schroeder](https://twitter.com/ctschroeder), [Allen Riddel](https://twitter.com/ariddell) and others on Twitter pointed out that, especially in non-English DH fields, many corpora are already on GitHub. These include texts from the [Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association](https://github.com/cltk/chinese_text_cbeta_indices), the [Open Greek and Latin Project](http://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin) at Leipzig, and papyri from the [Integrating Digital Papyrology Project](https://github.com/papyri/idp.data). The [Text Creation Partnership](http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/) has released some 25,000 of their texts in January of this year, and [uploaded them to GitHub](https://github.com/textcreationpartnership). 

One of the more interesting Git corpus projects I became aware of is [GITenberg](https://github.com/GITenberg). Led by [Seth Woodward](https://github.com/sethwoodworth), the project scrapes a text from Project Gutenberg, initializes a git repository for it, adds README and CONTRIBUTING files generated from the text's metadata, and uploads the resulting repository to GitHub. There are also efforts to convert PG vanilla plain text into [ASCIIDOC]. A good example of this is the GITenberg edition of [The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn](https://github.com/GITenberg/Adventures-of-Huckleberry-Finn_76/blob/master/book.asciidoc).
