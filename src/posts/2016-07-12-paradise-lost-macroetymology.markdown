One of Milton’s terms for the expansive, empty gulf separating the Earth
from Hell is the “abyss.” The word appears eighteen times in *Paradise
Lost*, and in seven out of twelve of the poem’s books. It is variously
described as “vast,” “dark,” “infinite,” “hollow,” “wild,” “wide,”
“desolate,” and “vexed,” (1.21, 2.405, 2.518, 2.910, 3.84, 4.936,
10.314) but also more epistemologically as “immeasurable,”
“untractable,” and “unbottomed” (7.211, 10.476, 2.405). Besides
emphasizing the distance of Satan’s followers’ fall, these last three
Chaotic epithets highlight the etymology of “abyss,” as derived from the
ancient Greek *ἄβυσσος* meaning, according to the *OED*, “bottomless,
unfathomed, unfathomable, boundless” <span class="citation">(“Abyss,
N.”)</span>. This is but one example of the way Milton acknowledges the
origins of words, and how the logic of his poem depends heavily on
etymology. Much has been made of this. On this basis, critics such as
Samuel Johnson, F.R. Leavis, and T.S. Eliot dismiss Milton as
un-English. More recently, Christopher Ricks, Hannah Crawforth, and John
Hale celebrate him for his multilingual style. However, whether
approving or disapproving of this method, no critic has yet attempted to
quantitatively measure the etymologies of Milton’s words. The following
describes an experiment in macro-etymological analysis of Milton’s
*Paradise Lost*, whereby the origins of the epic’s words are quantified
by book, section, and speaker. This experiment hopes to reveal trends in
the voices and resonances of the poem’s etymological registers that
invite the reader to imagine Biblical or classical parallels.

Milton is perhaps the ideal subject for a macro-etymological analysis.
By some accounts, he was familiar with around ten languages, and wrote
fluently in at least four <span class="citation">(Hale 8)</span>. Among
these were French, Latin, and Ancient Greek: the major ancestral
languages of English. Milton’s multilinguality is one factor that leads
Roy Flannagan to dub him “the most etymological of poets,” explaining
that “he may use a word in two English senses, several Latin senses, and
a Greek sense, all at the same time,” citing in particular his use of
“essence” and “effluence” <span class="citation">(Milton, *The Riverside
Milton* 316)</span>. John Carey and Alistair Fowler observe that “Milton
would of course know the etymology of many of the words in *Paradise
Lost*,” and add that “the interplay between words of Romance and of
Anglo-Saxon origin is an important feature of Milton’s style” <span
class="citation">(Milton, *The Poems of John Milton* 431)</span>. It is
exactly this interplay that the present experiment proposes to measure.

In an obscure Latin work of Milton’s, *The Art of Logic*, he argues that
etymological work can help to discover the truer (more divine) sense of
a concept. He does so using a lapsarian metaphor quite familiar to
readers of *Paradise Lost* and a more specifically linguistic metaphor:
that of the tower of Babel.

> Languages, both that first one which Adam spoke in Eden, and those
> varied ones also possibly derived from the first, which the builders
> of the tower of Babel suddenly received, are without doubt divinely
> given; hence it is not strange if the reason of primitive words is
> unknown. But as to those words that are derived or composite, either
> their origins are to be sought in other languages ancient and now
> obsolete, or by their own antiquity and the usually corrupt
> pronunciation of the lower classes are so changed, and by the habit of
> writing them falsely are so obliterated as it were that a true
> notation of words very seldom may be had. <span
> class="citation">(Milton, *A Fuller Institution of the Art of Logic,
> Arranged After the Method of Peter Ramus* 219–21)</span>

The “sudden receiving” of language at the tower of Babel also takes
place in the concluding book of *Paradise Lost*:

> Quite out their native language, and instead    
> To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:    
> Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud     
> Among the builders; each to other calls    
> Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage,    
> As mocked they storm; great laughter was in heaven    
> And looking down, to see the hubbub strange    
> And hear the din; thus was the building left    
> Ridiculous, and the work Confusion named.    

This passage features a smattering of onomatopoeia—“jangling,” “gabble,”
and “hubbub”—words with non-classical etymologies, that is, “primitive
words” whose “reason” is “unknown.” The *OED* notes that although
“Babel” and the onomatopoetic “babble” are etymologically unrelated, it
is related to French “*babel*,” “confusion of opinions,” and in Genesis
11 it is “folk-etymologically associated with Hebrew bālal ‘to confuse,
confound.’” <span class="citation">(“Babel, N.”)</span>. The linguistic
fall from grace that Milton recreates in this Babel scene, therefore,
can be viewed as etymological.

Later in *The Art of Logic*, Milton illustrates his logical system by
arguing on Latin etymological grounds that the statement “he is a man,
therefore he is from the earth,” *homo ab humo*, is preferable to its
opposite, “he is from the earth, therefore he is a man,” *humo ab homo*
<span class="citation">(Milton, *A Fuller Institution of the Art of
Logic, Arranged After the Method of Peter Ramus* 219)</span>. This
rhyming etymological connection is one which fuels God’s pun in
*Paradise Lost*: “because in thee / Love hath abounded more then Glory
abounds / Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt / With thee thy Manhood
also to this Throne” (3.311-14). This sense of “humiliation” is not the
*OED* sense 2 of “humiliate,” in which it is most commonly used today,
“to lower or depress the dignity or self-respect of,” although it
retains these undertones <span class="citation">(“Humiliate,
V.”)</span>. It is closer to the first sense, now obscure, “to make low
or humble in position,” but closer still to the etymological sense of
the word, ultimately descended from *humus*, “ground, earth” <span
class="citation">(“Humble, Adj.”)</span>. Thus, the Son “humiliates”
himself by going down to Earth. Furthermore, by incarnating himself, he
is enacting the same kind of transmogrification of Genesis 2.7, where
Adam is formed from earth, a literalization of *humo ab homo*.

Milton’s etymological sense, that which refigures “humiliation” into
“Earth-going,” is exactly that to which some critics have objected. Some
have called this Milton’s “Latinity,” and argue that it detracts from
his poetic power in English. Samuel Johnson ridicules Milton’s “play on
words, in which he delights too often,” and counts among his faults his
propensity “to use English words with a foreign idiom” <span
class="citation">(Johnson 84, 86)</span>. Johnson concludes that “of
him, at last, may be said what Jonson says of Spenser, that *he wrote no
language*, but has formed what Butler calls a *Babylonish Dialect*, in
itself harsh and barbarous, but made by exalted genius and extensive
learning” <span class="citation">(86)</span>.

T.S. Eliot happily quotes this passage from Johnson in his critique of
Milton, adding that Milton has been a “bad influence” over centuries of
poets, in part due to “the peculiar kind of deterioration … to which he
subjected language” <span class="citation">(32)</span>. This
deterioration he attributes to Milton’s affinity for Latin and Greek:
“Milton writes English like a dead language. The criticism has been made
with regard to his involved syntax” <span class="citation">(35)</span>.

Similarly, Joseph Addison, writing in *The Spectator* in the eighteenth
century, derides Milton for his poor punning. He quotes from a passage
in Book 6 where Belial answers Satan, calling it “nothing else but a
string of puns, and those too very indifferent” <span
class="citation">(37)</span>:

> stumbl’d many, who receives them right,   
> Had need from head to foot well understand;    
> Not understood, this gift they have besides,    
> They show us when our foes walk not upright. (6.609-29)

The pun that Addison notices is a kind of literalizing folk etymology of
“understand,” refiguring comprehension as a kind of posture, an
“upright” “standing” “from head to foot.” These kinds of puns happen
throughout *Paradise Lost*, and they are often etymological in nature.
It is this kind of linguistic wordplay that invites an analysis of the
poem attentive to its etymological registers.

Experimental Design
===================

The following macro-etymological analysis was conducted with a tool I
developed for this purpose called the Macro-Etymological Analyzer. The
tool divides a given text into its constituent words, lemmatizes the
words (transforms them into their dictionary forms), removes
commonly-used words such as “a” and “the” (“stopwords,”) and looks up
each remaining word in the [Etymological
Wordnet](http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~demelo/etymwn/), a multilingual
etymological database created by computer scientist Gerard de Melo. If
the program finds that a word’s ancestor is Middle English, its default
behavior is to go one generation deeper, since a large proportion of
English words have Middle English ancestors. The program then tallies
the words of the text according to their origin languages and origin
language families. This groups together words descended from Old
English, Old Norse, and other Germanic languages under the language
family “Germanic,” and groups together words descended from Latin,
French, Anglo-Norman, and other Romance languages under “Latinate.”
Words descended from Ancient Greek are categorized as Hellenic, and so
on.

Although the Macro-Etymological Analyzer was originally written as [a
web app](http://jonreeve.com/etym) designed to analyze single files, I
rewrote the program in Python with a command-line interface (CLI), in
order to allow it to be scriptable, and allow for easy analysis of
multiple files. Thus, instead of uploading individual files to a server
and analyzing them one-by-one, users may execute the CLI interface,
leveraging shell expansion:
`python macro_etym.py paradise-lost-books/*.txt`, where `*.txt` will be
expanded to match all the text files in the directory. Furthermore, the
tool was modified so that it can easily output a file formatted with
comma separated values (CSV), an easily machine-readable format. This
allows for simple post-analysis of the data generated by the initial
macro-etymological analysis.

Apart from the tool creation, preparation of the *Paradise Lost* text
was one of the most labor-intensive processes in this analysis. To
begin, [an edition of *Paradise Lost* richly marked-up in Text Encoding
Initiative Extensible Markup Language](http://ota.ox.ac.uk/desc/3022)
(TEI XML) was retrieved from the [Oxford Text
Archive](http://ota.ox.ac.uk/). The greatest difficulty of dealing with
this text was that the orthography was retained in its original, a
feature incompatible with the modern spellings used in the Etymological
Wordnet. To correct this problem, I used the [VARD
2](http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/vard/about/) tool to normalize the spelling
in a quasi-supervised way. First, the text was automatically corrected
using VARD’s native dictionary, given a threshold of 40% certainty. From
there, the text was corrected by hand, manually replacing thousands of
words with their modern equivalents. This resulted in [a new,
semi-automatically generated
edition](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/milton-analysis/blob/master/pl-normalized.xml)
of the text, where normalized variants are marked up as, for instance,
`<normalised orig="exprest" auto="true">expressed</normalised>`.

One of the most useful features of this TEI XML edition is that speech
attribution is semantically marked up with milestones, as in
`<milestone n="narr" unit="sp"/>`, where `narr` is the narrator of the
poem. In this case, the narrator’s speech follows this tag. This allows
for the extraction of speech elements, although not in the usual way,
using an XML parsing library. Instead, I wrote [a
script](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/milton-analysis/blob/master/extract/pl-dialog-extractor.ipynb)
to retrieve the all the speech between these tags using regular
expressions. The script categorizes each text chunk by speaker, and
writes the aggregated text to individual text files, using the
character’s name as the filename. This allows for a simple
macro-etymological analysis using the shell expansion command outlined
above.

In order to analyze the individual books of the poem, I wrote [a similar
script](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/milton-analysis/blob/master/extract/pl-book-extractor.ipynb)
that parses the XML and extracts the text contained within
`<div type="Book">` tags. To divide these into subsections for more
fine-grained analysis, I constructed a simple BASH command that uses the
GNU command `split` to divide each book into equal-sized chunks:
`for file in *; do split -n 10 $file ${file:r}; done`.

Results
=======

Overall, once stopwords are removed, roughly 60% of the words of
*Paradise Lost* are Latinate, from Anglo-Norman, French, Middle French,
Old French, and Latin, mostly. Another 35% are Germanic, from Old
English, Old Norse, or German. The remaining few percentage points are
divided between Hellenic (Ancient Greek, at around 1%), Semitic (Hebrew,
0.25%), and other language families. Since Latinate and Germanic
proportions account for the majority of the total words of the poem,
they correlate negatively with one another. A high proportion of
Latinate words in a section almost always means a low proportion of
Germanic words. For this reason, this study will mostly examine the
proportions of Latinate words in *Paradise Lost*.

<figure>
![Figure 1: Paradise Lost Books, Proportions of Latinate Words](/images/milton-macroetym/books-latinate.png)
<figcaption>Figure 1: Paradise Lost Books, Proportions of Latinate Words</figcaption>
</figure>

Figure 1 shows the overall proportions of Latinate words in the books of
*Paradise Lost*. The Latinity of the epic starts, one might say, *in
medias res*, grows as the rhetoric of Hell reaches a climax in Book 2,
but dips back down by Book 3 with the less Latinate dialogue between God
and the Son. Book 4 is the absolute nadir, representing the lowest
proportion of Latinate words: this corresponds with Satan’s (and our)
first glimpse of Adam and Eve, and the natural world of Eden which
Milton represents using words of Germanic origin. After Book 4, the
Latinity of the poem increases until it reaches an absolute climax in
Book 6. Since Raphael relates the heavenly war in Book 6 using the
armaments and materials of classical epics, this high proportion
suggests a correlation with a classicist mode. After Book 6, the books
alternate in Latinity, although decreasing steadily until the poem ends.

When this analysis is conducted on a finer scale, that is, when each
book is broken into ten sections, a different picture emerges. Figure 2
shows proportions of Latinate words per subsection. Sharp alternations
between high and low Latinate proportions characterize most of this
poem—the sawtooth shape suggests that Milton is quickly switching
rhetorical modes, and that this switching increases its pace as the poem
progresses.

In this finer analysis, the most Latinate passage is not in Book 6, in
fact, but directly before it, in the penultimate section of Book 5, `ai`
(sections are ordered `aa-aj`). This section starts at line 716 and
continues through 815. It contains Satan’s speech to his followers,
where he attempts to convince them with “calumnious Art of counterfeited
truth” (770-1), and to tempt them with “Thrones, Dominations,
Princedoms, Virtues, Powers” (772), so long as “these magnific titles
yet remain not merely titular” (773-4). With the exception of the
Anglo-Saxon-derived “Princedoms,” all of the words in this series are
descended from Latin, and arrive either through French or through
Anglo-Norman.

<figure>
![Figure 2: Paradise Lost Subsections, Proportions of Latinate
Words](/images/milton-macroetym//subsections-latinate.png)
<figcaption>Figure 2: *Paradise Lost* Subsections, Proportions of Latinate Words</figcaption>
</figure>

This section has Satan assume an air of high rhetoric, where he will
ask, “Who can in reason then or right assume / Monarchy over such as
live by right \[God’s\] equals, if in power and splendor less, / In
freedom equal?” (795-8). This is a similar stance toward monarchy as
presented in Milton’s tract, “The Ready and Easy Way to Establish a Free
Commonwealth,” also a heavily Latinate text. Roy Flannagan explains that
this speech of Satan’s is “characterized by orotundity and repetition,”
and that his choice of the Latinate “magnific” at 773, instead of an
Anglo-Saxon “great” or “great-making,” “shows how Satan is flattering
his audience” <span class="citation">(Milton, *The Riverside Milton*
500)</span>.

In contrast, Abdiel’s response to Satan is much less Latinate and thus
much more Germanic. He argues that “to \[God’s\] only Son by right
endued / With regal scepter, every soul in heaven / Shall bend the knee,
and in that honor due / Confess him rightful king” (815-18). Abdiel’s
rhetorical authority comes not from high Latinate eloquence, but from a
primal Germanic power: apart from the Latinate “endued,” “regal,”
“scepter,” this retort is peppered with the Old English-derived words
“son,” “soul,” “heaven,” “bend,” “knee,” “rightful,” and “king.”

The passage with the lowest proportions of Latinate words is Book 3,
section `ag`, which starts at line 429, and continues until 507. The
passage that directly precedes this section begins by marking the stark
contrast between the scene of heavenly rejoicing for the Son and Satan’s
vulture-like circling of the Earth:

> Thus they in heaven, above the starry sphere,    
> Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent.    
> Meanwhile upon the firm opacous globe    
> Of this round world, whose first convex divides    
> The luminous inferiour orbs, enclosed    
> From Chaos and the inroad of darkness old,    
> Satan alighted walks (416-22)

The macro-etymological shift from Latinate to Germanic in this section
enacts the heaven/Satan contrast along the fault-lines of language
history. Directly after this passage, the narrator describes in heavily
Germanic speech this liminal space between Chaos and the earth, as
“dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of night / Starless” (425-6).
Milton then compares Satan, in an epic simile, to “a vulture on Imaus
bred, / Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds” (431-2). (Flannagan
explains that “*Imaus*” etymologically conveys the idea of a snow-capped
mountain <span class="citation">(Milton, *The Riverside Milton*
428)</span>). This vulture departs from “a Region scarce of prey” in
order to

> gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids    
> On hills were flocks are fed, flies toward the springs    
> Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams;    
> But in his way lights on the barren plains    
> Of Sericana, where Chineses drive    
> With sails and wind their cany wagons light:    
> So on this windy sea of land, the fiend    
> Walked up and down alone bent on his prey (434-441)

This passage, while very geographical, is also primal, pastoral, and
earthy: qualities all associated with the Germanic register. The
pastoral image of “yeanling kids” is, of course, ultimately a dark one,
where their flesh is feasted upon by this vulture. This makes the
pastoral/prey contrast, as in the heaven/Chaos contrast above, all the
more stark. Germanic words here, such as “hills,” “flocks,” “flies,”
“springs,” “lights,” “plains,” “drive,” “sails,” “wind,” and “sea,” not
only serve to contrast with the vulture and thus with Satan, but set the
scene, even in this brief aside, for the introduction of the World in
Book 4.

The etymological contrast between Satan and Abdiel noted above occurs
between many other characters in *Paradise Lost*, as well. As each
character has his or her own voice, motives, and rhetorical style, these
features are often reflected in the etymologies of their words. Figure 3
shows the Latinate proportions for each of the speakers in *Paradise
Lost*. The speakers with the highest percentages of Latinate words are
the narrator, Adam, and Raphael, while the speakers with the lowest are
the minor characters Zophiel, Nisroc, and Zephon<span id="fnref1" class="fnref">[1](#fn1)</span>.
With only 84, 131, and 76 words each, however, these last
three fallen angels likely do not show high proportions of Latinate
words simply because they are not given the chance to—their speech
samples are not large enough. Analyzing only the main characters—that
is, characters who speak more than two thousand words<span id="fnref2" class="fnref">[2](#fn2)</span>
—the characters with the lowest proportions of Latinate
words are Eve, the Son, and the Father. This seems to suggest that the
narrator, Adam, and Raphael all perform higher levels of discourse than
God, the Son, and Eve.

To study the voices of the characters in greater detail, I wrote [a
script to determine each character’s distinctive
words](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/milton-analysis/blob/master/tf-idf/tfidf-custom.ipynb).
This script works by counting each word a speaker uses, and divides that
count by the number of times it is used by other speakers. To avoid
difficulties arising from comparing characters with logarithmically
different word counts, I again only compared the major characters. The
most distinctive word of the narrator is “replied,” which he or she uses
almost four times as often as any other character. There aren’t very
many Latinate words in this list, although the narrator’s twelfth most
distinctive word is “answered.” Since both of these words are functional
for telling a story in the past tense, the narrative task might account
for some of the narrator’s high proportions of Latinate words.

Before stopwords are removed, the resulting distinctive words are
revealing about the characters’ voices. Of Satan’s, John Hale argues
that “that voice is many things but always self-preoccupied” <span
class="citation">(136)</span>. Yet a closer look at Satan’s distinctive
words shows “you,” “your” and “ye” ranked in his top four, seemingly
refuting Hale’s claim. Adam’s distinctive words, on the other hand, are
much more self-preoccupied: “us,” “my,” and “we” suggest introversion.

Adam’s most distinctive word, once stopwords were removed, however, is
the word “sustain,” descended from Latin and arriving in English via
Anglo-Norman. There are the Latinate words “approve,” “absence,” and
“favor,” but also the distinctly Anglo-Saxon words “bone,” “dust,”
“need,” and “feel.”. By contrast, Eve’s most distinctive words are the
Latinate “forbids,” but also the Germanic “early,” “dreamed,”
“glistering,” and “help.” The top distinctive words of God and the Son,
at ranks \#1 and \#2, respectively, are the Latinate words “redeem” and
“redeemed.” One might hypothesize that these would be words distinctive
of fallen angels eager to reenter heaven, so it is surprising that they
should correlate instead with the heavenly monarchy.

<figcaption>Figure 3: Proportions of Latinate Words among Speakers</figcaption>
</figure>

One of the superficial features of Latinate words is that they are
frequently composed of root words and affixes. The Latinate prefixes
“con-,” “dis-,” “pre-,” “un-,” and “re-” are especially common in
*Paradise Lost*. Figure 4 shows the distribution of these prefixes
across the books of the poem. This distribution was generated using [a
simple Conditional Frequency Distribution](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/milton-analysis/blob/master/cfd-plots.ipynb) from the
Python Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) module, which tests whether a
word starts with the prefix. To account for words like “rest,” which in
fact begins with “re-” but is not etymologically composed of the “re-”
prefix, I created a blacklist containing words like “regent,” “reason,”
“prey,” “under,” and “union.”

<figure>
![Figure 4: Prefixes, by Book, Not Normalized for Word
Count](/images/milton-macroetym/prefixes-books-notnormalized.png)
<figcaption>Figure 4: Prefixes, by Book, Not Normalized for Word Count</figcaption>
</figure>

“Re-” is by far the most common of these prefixes, accounting for the
distinctive word of the narrator, “replied,” as well as God and the
Son’s distinctive lemma, “redeem.” Book 10 shows the highest frequency
of this prefix, as to be expected for a postlapsarian book of regret and
inability to return. In fact, the word “return” occurs sixteen times in
Book 10, as in Adam’s lament “dust I am, and shall to dust return” (770)
and the Son’s sentence “in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, /
Till thou return unto the ground” (205-6). Milton doubles “re-” words
frequently in this book, as well, with “reflux on me redound” (739),
“with stern regard he thus repelled,” (866), and “Eve, recovering heart,
replied” (966). The book ends with Eve’s “remorse” (1098) and with the
couple’s “reverent” (1100) posture of prayer before God.

If “re-” is the prefix most characteristic of Book 10, then “dis-” is
that of the preceding Book 9. Introducing the book, the narrator warns
that he will speak no more of “rural repast,” (another “re-” word) (4),
but must change the tone (and implictly the predominant prefix) of the
poem:

>                                        I now must change    
> those notes to tragic; foul distrust, and breach    
> Disloyal on the part of man, revolt,    
> And disobedience: on the part of heaven    
> Now alienated, distance and distaste (5-9)

About this passage, Christopher Ricks comments that “one’s interest in
the phrase is surely aroused by its alliterative crescendo; we rise with
pauses through ‘discourse … distrust … disloyal … disobedience’ to the
full clash of the cymbals in *distance and distaste*” <span
class="citation">(Ricks 69)</span>. Apart from their musicality, this
passage’s preponderance of “dis-” words emphasize the disobedience that
is the narrator’s declared subject of the poem. Other dis- words that
appear in this book include the ominiously-voiced “divine displeasure,”
(994), “discord” (1124), and “dissent” (1160).

The prefix “un-” operates in a similar way to “dis-,” and is an even
more important prefix for the poem, whose original title was “Adam
Unpardis’d.” “Un-” is furthermore the site of many of Milton’s
neologisms. As Flannagan observes: “Milton is especially fond of making
up negative compound words, such as ‘unbesought,’ ‘undelighted,’
‘disespouse,’ or ‘inabstinence’” <span class="citation">(Milton, *The
Riverside Milton* 316)</span>. These often occur in chains of three,
such as in Belial’s worry that the angels should be further “unrespited,
unpitied, unreprieved” (2.184-5). Fowler notes that this is “asyndeton
(omission of grammatical connections) … combined with similarity or
sameness of prefix,” and locates precedents among the Greek tragedians,
Spenser, and Shakespeare <span class="citation">(Milton, *The Poems of
John Milton* 516)</span>. Thomas Corns calls this a common “stylistic
motif” of Milton’s <span class="citation">(84–5)</span>. These chains
happen two more times, with the narrator’s “unprevented, unimplored,
unsought” (3.231), and the Son’s “unshaked, unseduced,
unterrified”<span id="fnref3" class="fnref">[3](#fn3)</span>(5.899).

<figure>
![Figure 5: Prefixes by Speaker, Normalized by
Wordcount](/images/milton-macroetym/prefixes-speakers-normalized.png)
<figcaption>Figure 5: Prefixes by Speaker, Normalized by Wordcount</figcaption>
</figure>

Analyzed by speaker, some surprising trends emerge. Figure 5 shows
prefix usage by each of the main characters, adjusted for the total
number of words each character speaks. The characters that use “re-” the
most are not, as one would imagine, Satan, whose ambitions are to
“repair” or “return” to Heaven, but God, Michael, and the Son.
Similarly, the negative “un-” prefix does not appear the most among
Satan or his followers, but among Eve and the Son. “Con-,” of “confuse,”
“contempt,” and “converse,” appears most frequently in Adam’s speech,
and there is very little variation among the other prefixes.

Conclusions and Further Research
================================

Milton is, as claimed by his detractors and apologists alike, a heavily
Latinate poet. The etymological/rhetorical climax of *Paradise Lost*, as
seen in proportions of Latinate words, does not occur where one might
expect, around the time of the fall, but with the heavenly war in Book
6. This makes the poem fairly symmetrical in terms of its Germanic and
Latinate registers. The characters who exhibit the most heavily Latinate
speech are the narrator, Adam, and Raphael, while those who exhibit the
least are Eve, the Son, and God. This lends some credence to readings of
*Paradise Lost* that award Satan the prize for the most rhetorically
convincing arguments, instead of God and the Son. Finally, this
experiment found that “re-” prefixed words are not distinctive of Satan,
as one might imagine, but of God and the Son.

Future research might build on the methods developed here for use with
other texts, or with further analyses of these texts. Using the tools
created for this experiment, it might be possible to create an
etymologically annotated edition of *Paradise Lost*, for instance. This
edition would color-code words according to language origin family, in
order to show the reader at a glance where clusters of origin language

# Note
The source code for this project, as well as [a nice PDF version of this paper](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/milton-analysis/blob/master/paper/pl-macro-etym.pdf) can all be found [on the project GitHub repository](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/milton-analysis). All of the analyses, as well as many others that didn't make the final cut for this paper, are available there as Jupyter notebooks. You can run these notebooks on your own computer using Jupyter, and modify them slightly to conduct similar analyses of _Paradise Lost_ or other texts. The command-line program used to generate the macro-etymological results is now available [on GitHub](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/macro-etym) and [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/macroetym/).
