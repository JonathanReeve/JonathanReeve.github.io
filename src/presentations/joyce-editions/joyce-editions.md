# The Open Critical Editions of Joyce’s _Ulysses_ and _A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man_ 

---

## Traditional Editions

 - Often privately owned/copyrighted by for-profit insitutions
 - Contain errors (“geen”/“green”) that can’t be corrected
 - Notes and backgrounds are limited by the size of the paper and book

---

## Open Critical Editions

 - Belong to everyone (copyleft)
 - Errors are correctable
 - Margins are virtually infinite
 - Readers can choose what information to show/hide
 - Computer readable; good for computer analysis 

---

## Semantic Markup 

 - Written in TEI XML (Text Encoding Initiative eXtensible Markup Language) 
 - Semantic markup is a way to describe literary features
 - More about literary criticism than computer programming

## Plain Text
