#+TITLE: A Bookmarklet For Creating Annotags
#+DATE: 2015-04-25
#+TAGS: annotation; open source

At [[http://iannotate.org/][I Annotate]] this weekend, I made a bookmarklet that will allow you to generate an [[/projects/annotags/about.html][Annotag]] from a book's bibliographic entry:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <p class="center">
#+END_HTML

Tweet This Book

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </p>
#+END_HTML

To use it:

- Drag the button above onto your bookmarks bar.
- Visit a website that has books. It currently works with [[http://worldcat.org][Worldcat]] and [[https://www.gutenberg.org/][Project Gutenberg]].
- Click the bookmarklet.
- Add a location suffix to the hashtag, if you want, like =:p26=.
- Tweet a comment about the book.

The bookmarklet extracts book identifiers from your URL, encodes it in base-62, and takes you to Twitter, where this information will be be waiting for you, encoded as a hashtag. Now it's even easier to tweet about books!

If you'd like to help improve the code, it can be found [[https://github.com/JonathanReeve/annotags/blob/master/annotag-tweetme.js][here on GitHub]].
