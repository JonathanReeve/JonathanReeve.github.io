* Jonreeve.com

I'm Jonathan Reeve, and this is my personal website, [[https://jonreeve.com/][jonreeve.com]]. It's written in Haskell, and built with [[https://github.com/srid/ema][Ema]].

** Hacking

You won't need to do this unless you're me. But to run locally,

#+begin_src sh
bin/run
#+end_src

To generate the static site:

#+begin_src sh
nix build
./result/bin/jonreeve gen dist/
#+end_src
