** 1870: Hansen Writing Ball

** 1870: Hansen Writing Ball

- First mass-produced typewriter
- Used by Friedrich Nietzsche
- Nietzsche's aphoristic "telegraph style" philosophy influenced by this

** 1870: Hansen Writing Ball

- Nietzche very frustrated
- N: "Our writing tools are also working on our thoughts"

** 1874: Scholes and Glidden Type-writer

- Manufactured by Remington Comapany
- (Sewing machine manufacturers)

** 1874: Scholes and Glidden Type-writer

- QWERTY layout prevents jamming of physical keys
- Letters for /typewriter/ placed on first row to aid salesmen

* Keyboard Layout

** Think about fingers
- How do they move across your keyboard?

** What is the most common letter in English?
- Why is it on the top row of the left hand?

** QWERTY Heatmap

** 1936: Dvorak

** 2006: Colemak Layout

- Some compromise with QWERTY
- The most efficient

** 2006: Colemak Layout

** Make Your Own Heatmap

** In Other Languages

- QWERTY often still used
- Problems with QWERTY are amplified

** 2017: Bépo (French)

** 2004: Neo

** Accesibility Issues

** Mobile phone keyboards

- They have the opportunity to change this
- But they mostly reproduce this problem

* Keyboard Design

** Left-staggered columns

- Especially bad for the left hand
- That's where the E is

** Ortholinear keyboards
- Fixes the problem with left-staggered keyboards
- Easier to make

** Ortholinear keyboards

** Ortholinear keyboards

** Columnar-staggered keyboards
- Account for different finger lengths
- Account for natural hand placement

** Columnar-staggered keyboards

[[./images/atreus.jpg]]

** 75%, 60%, 40% keyboards

- Move your hands less
- Fewer carpal-tunnel problems
- Less looking at the keyboard

** 40% Keyboard

[[./images/40pct.jpg]]

** Split Keyboards

** Switches

- Not all fingers have the same strength — why should switches be?
- Modularity is better for hackability
  - And Right-to-repair

* Keyboard Theory

** Technological Debt
- Inherited technological problems

** We use keys that are on our keyboards
- Emoji (mobile phone keyboards)
- The @ symbol, orig. used for prices, now used frequently in email addresses

** Vestigial typewriter keys

- Underscore: _ : used for underlining
- Carat: ^ : used for circumflexes (/fête/ in French)
- Tilde: ~ : used
- Now all used for other things

** We rarely type glyphs that aren't on our keyboards

- em-dash: —
- en-dash: –
- Many don't even know what these are

** We need some glyphs, but can't type them

[[./images/pisticci.jpg]]

** Try typing these English words

- café
- caffè
- naïve

** Bad keyboard design leads to stupidity

- It's harder to **think of** typing letters we can't see on our keyboards

** False dilemmas

- Keyboards, GUI menus provide the illusion of choice
- Hobson's choice
- "You can choose any color, so long as it's black"
- Who knows how to use an em-dash now?

* Language itself is a keyboard

** Spelling is a keyboard

- Why is spelling so hard?
- We invented spelling! Who's in charge here?
- Through, cough, bough, although, rough
- Why do we have to type all those letters?

** We invent few new words
- Except for new products

** Most new words are jokes
- (Because we are nervous about violating language rules!)
- Older generation: misspellings: OK
- Younger generation: pormanteaux: ginormous, bromance

** English is conservative
- Conservative, brittle, inexpressive
- You probably disagree unless you speak several other non-European languages fluently, then you get it.

* Conservative thinking
** Even politically liberal people are conservative about new ideas
- New thoughts, ideas are scare
- But it's just not what I'm used to!
- But no one else does it!
** Argumentum ad populum

- "If idea X is so great, why isn't it espoused by millions?"
  - Logical fallacy
  - Evaluating ideas through social valor is bad

** Argumentum ad populum
- Why do we celebrate people who are visionaries, or ahead of their time, yet fail to recognize them among us?

** Argumentum ad populum
 - Groupthink
   + A concept from 1984 (Orwell)
   + No one individually believes in an idea, but everyone thinks others do

** Nietzche again

"Our writing tools are also working on our thoughts"

* Solutions / Recommendations
** Use a good keyboard layout
- Colemak is a good starter

** Use a good keyboard
- Keyboard.io's Atreus is a good starter

** Define your own ergonomics
- Set up your workstation to work with, not against, your body.

** Define your own input
- Program your keyboard such that it outputs the glyphs you want

** Use a good language
- Esperanto is an exceptionally easy language (learn in 2 weeks)
- Spoken by 5 million people worldwide
- Fixes spelling with transparent orthography

** Rethink technological debt
- Recognize technological debt
- Think outside the box

** Regognize cognitive bias
- Where do your preferences and opinions come from?
