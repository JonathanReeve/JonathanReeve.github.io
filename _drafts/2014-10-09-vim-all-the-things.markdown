Imagine a world where key commands have a logical symmetry to them. The super key ("Command" in MacOS or the "Windows Key" in Windows) would control the operating system or window manager, Alt would control a group of programs, and Control would control the program. For instance, Super + L would take you to the program on the right. Alt + L would take you to that program's right pane, and Control + L would take you to the right within that pane. There's a logical hierarchy to it. Thankfully, with a little bit of configuration, this is all well within reach. You can set up i3 to move around your system with HJKL movements, and then 

Vim is about the greatest thing ever. One of the best things about it is that it's designed to be incredibly efficient and ergonomic. It often just takes a couple keystrokes with Vim to perform an editing task that would take several key combinations or mouse movements with a WYSIWYG word processor. The problem is, it's too good. When you get used to it, you're so spoiled by it that it can be frustrating to work with other programs, because the key commands are so inefficient. With a little configuring, though, you can vimify just about everything about your computing environment. Here are the basic ingredients: 

1. Window manager: i3 or Awesome WM. 
2. Shell: BASH or ZSH with Vim mode.
3. Web browser: dwb, jumanji, or the Vimperator / Pentadactyl plugins for Firefox. 
4. Python (interpreter), MySQL, or anything else that uses Readline
