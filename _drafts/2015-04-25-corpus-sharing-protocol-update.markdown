[Carrie Schroeder](https://twitter.com/ctschroeder), [Allen Riddel](https://twitter.com/ariddell) and others on Twitter have pointed out that, especially in non-English DH fields, many corpora are already on GitHub: 

 * [Gitenberg](https://github.com/GITenberg) is a GitHub user with repositories of Project Gutenberg texts. 

Non-English Corpora on GitHub Include: 
 
 * Texts from the [Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association](https://github.com/cltk/chinese_text_cbeta_indices)
 * The [Open Greek and Latin Project](http://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin) at Leipzig
 * Papyri from the [Integrating Digital Papyrology Project](https://github.com/papyri/idp.data)
